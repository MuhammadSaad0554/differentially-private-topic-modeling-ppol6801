## Repository Overview

This repository contains all code, data objects, figures, and written materials required to replicate the analysis presented in the final project for PPOL 6801. The project studies privacy risks in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and evaluates simplified differential privacy (DP) mechanisms applied to topic modeling using the 20 Newsgroups dataset.

The repository is structured to reflect the full analytical workflow: data acquisition and preprocessing, exploratory privacy risk analysis, baseline topic modeling, and differentially private perturbation and evaluation of model outputs.

## Data Sources

### 20 Newsgroups Dataset

The primary data source is the **20 Newsgroups dataset**, accessed programmatically via the `scikit-learn` Python library using `reticulate` from R.

- **Source:** `sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`
- **Time period:** Early 1990s (approximately 1993–1995)
- **Content:** Approximately 18,000 Usenet discussion posts across 20 topical categories
- **Unit of observation:** Individual post (document-level)

The dataset is downloaded directly within the notebooks and does not require external credentials or API keys.

## Data Directory (`/data`)

This repository includes processed data objects and saved model artifacts to support reproducibility while avoiding unnecessary duplication of raw text files.

### Contents

- `20news_raw.rds`  
  Dataset extracted from `fetch_20newsgroups`, containing post text, newsgroup labels, and extracted metadata fields.

- `20news_pseudonymized.rds`  
  Version of the dataset after preprocessing and pseudonymization. This file retains only anonymized user identifiers, newsgroup labels, and cleaned post text.

- `lda_objects.RData`  
  Saved R objects containing preprocessed document-feature matrices and baseline LDA model objects used in subsequent analyses.

## Notebooks (`/notebooks`)

### `00_EDA_Privacy_Risks.rmd`

This notebook performs exploratory analysis of the 20 Newsgroups dataset. It examines user participation patterns, extracted metadata fields, and text characteristics. The notebook applies preprocessing and pseudonymization procedures and generates summary statistics and visualizations. Intermediate datasets are saved for downstream analysis.

**Inputs:**  
- 20 Newsgroups data retrieved programmatically from `scikit-learn`

**Outputs:**  
- Processed datasets saved to `/data`  
- Figures saved to `/figures`

---

### `01_LDA_Privacy.rmd`

This notebook estimates a baseline Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model using Collapsed Gibbs Sampling. It examines topic–word distributions and evaluates the sensitivity of topics to the inclusion or exclusion of specific documents or users. The resulting model objects are saved for reuse.

**Inputs:**  
- Pseudonymized dataset from `/data`

**Outputs:**  
- Baseline LDA model objects  
- Topic-word distribution figures  
- Saved LDA objects for reuse

---

### `02_DP_LDA.rmd`

This notebook applies simplified differentially private perturbations to the baseline LDA outputs. It evaluates the effect of varying privacy budgets and sensitivity assumptions on topic coherence, interpretability, and stability. Results are summarized through figures and comparative analyses.

**Inputs:**  
- Saved LDA model objects from `/data/lda_objects.RData`

**Outputs:**  
- Privacy–utility curves  
- Topic stability visualizations  
- Figures saved to `/figures`

---

## Figures (`/figures`)

This directory contains all visualizations generated by the notebooks, including exploratory plots, stylometric projections, topic–word comparisons, privacy–utility curves, and topic stability analyses. All figures are reproducible from the notebooks.

## Written Materials

- `/proposal` – Project proposal  
- `/presentation` – Final presentation slides  
- `/report` – Final written report

## Reproducibility Notes

- All analyses are conducted in **R**, with Python dependencies accessed via `reticulate`
- No proprietary data or credentials are required
- Intermediate data objects and model outputs are saved to support reproducibility
- Random seeds are fixed where applicable
